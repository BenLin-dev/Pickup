/**
 * Guides / blog.
 *
 * Ten long-form articles aimed at the things international visitors and buyers
 * actually search for before they land in Guangdong. Topics overlap with what
 * any Guangzhou car service writes about — a travel guide category is a travel
 * guide category — but every paragraph here was written for CantonPickup.
 *
 * `image` points at `/images/blog/<slug>.jpg`. Body copy is stored as an array
 * of blocks so the renderer can decide on headings, paragraphs and lists
 * without parsing markdown:
 *
 *   { heading, body: [para, ...], list: [item, ...] }
 *
 * Add or reorder blocks freely; the article page renders whatever is there.
 *
 * `title` is the on-page `<h1>`, the card label and the breadcrumb, so it can be
 * as long as it reads well. The browser-tab / SERP string is
 * `` `${seoTitle || title} | CantonPickup` `` — the brand suffix costs 15
 * characters, and Bing fails a page over 60, so any article whose `title`
 * cannot absorb that gets an explicit `seoTitle` of at most 45 characters.
 * Both are read by `ArticleView.vue` and by `src/entry-server.js`.
