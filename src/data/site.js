 * `https://wa.me/<number>`, which opens an EMPTY composer. A visitor arriving
 * from an ad had to invent a sentence before anything could be answered — the
 * highest-intent tap on the whole site dead-ended in a blank box. The
 * reference site (cantonride.com) pre-fills "Hi, I need a transfer in
 * Guangzhou"; this is the same idea.
 *
 * Three separate values on purpose:
 *   - `whatsappUrl`   bare profile address. Used in structured data (`sameAs`)
 *                     and anywhere a canonical, parameterless URL is expected
 *                     — you do not want `?text=...` sitting in JSON-LD.
 *   - `whatsappLink`  what every human-facing button uses.
 *   - `whatsappText`  the message itself, exported so the copy can be shown or
 *                     asserted against without re-deriving it from the URL.
 *
 * Keep the message SHORT and ready to send as-is. A message containing blanks
 * the visitor has to fill in is worse than no message at all — on a phone they
 * would have to place a cursor mid-sentence.
