 * One entry per `Guangzhou to <City>` page. The copy is our own — the page

 * quote, fixed-price table, buyer angle, reverse direction, FAQ), but every
 * sentence here was written for CantonPickup.
 *
 * PRICING RULE — do not invent numbers.
 *
 * 2026-10-01: every `table` row was re-keyed against the client's new rate
 * card (`fixedRoutes` in site.js), which prices four vehicle tiers instead of
 * two — `sedan` / `mpv` / `luxury` (Mercedes-Benz) / `van9` (9-seat). The
 * airport leg used to be `null` — printed as "Quoted on request" — on five of
 * the six cities; the new card gives every leg a fixed figure, so those are
 * filled in. Where a leg genuinely has no number the row keeps `note` and the
 * table prints it. All fares are USD, per vehicle.
