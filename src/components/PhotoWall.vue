/**
 * "See Us in Action" — the photo wall.
 *
 * Everything in `public/images/gallery/` appears here, newest first, and
 * nothing else is required: no sidecar, no caption, no alt text, no separate
 * order file. `scripts/scan-assets.mjs` turns that folder into
 * `/data/gallery.json` before every build (keeping only the latest 30 photos)
 * and this component only reads it — the same folder-driven contract as the
 * review wall and the video grid, so adding a photo is "copy the file in,
 * rebuild" and it lands at the top of the wall.
 *
 * Layout is a CSS *multi-column* masonry, not a grid:
 *   - Columns let every photo keep its own shape. A portrait shot of a driver
 *     holding a name sign sits next to a wide shot of an open boot, and neither
 *     is cropped to fit a shared row height.
 *   - A grid can fake that with `grid-row: span 2` markers, but those markers
 *     can only be authored per image — exactly the thing this wall is built not
 *     to ask for. Columns work it out from the picture itself.
 *
 * There are no captions, so the photos carry no information a screen reader
 * could read out: they are marked decorative (`alt=""`) and the section is
 * announced by its own heading instead.
